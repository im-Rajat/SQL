# Lesson 3 (SQL Basic)

SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically **4 types of languages** in on
* Data Query Language (DQL)
* Data Definition Language (DDL)
* Data Control Language (DCL)
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)

**Queries:** A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
