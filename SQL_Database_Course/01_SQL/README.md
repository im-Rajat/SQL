# Lesson 1 (SQL)


SQL is a language which is used to interact with rational database management systems.

Rational database management systems is a software application which we can use to create and manage different databases.

## What is a Database
Any collection of related information - Phone Book, Shopping List, To do list, Facebook user base, etc.
It can be stored in different ways - on paper, in your mind, on a computer, etc.

**Databases can be stored:** On paper, In your mind, Computer, PowerPoint, comment section

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)
A special software program that helps users to create and maintain a database

**CRUD:** Create, Read (Retrieve), Update, Delete

## Two Types of Databases

1.  **Rational Databases (SQL)**
    * Organize data into one or more tables
        * Each table has columns and rows
        * A unique key identifies each row
2.  **Non-Relational (noSQL / not just SQL)**
    * Organize data is anything but a traditional table
        * Key-value stores/hash
        * Documents (JSON, XML, etc)
        * Graphs
        * Flexible Tables

* **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):** Helps users create and maintain a relational database
    * mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc
* **Structured Query Language (SQL)**

## Database Queries
Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information (A google search is query)

## Wrap Up

- Database is any collection of related information
- Computer are great for storing databases
- Database Management Systems (DBMS) make it easy to create, maintain and secure a database.
- DBMS allow you to perform the C.R.U.D operations and other administrative tasks
- Two types of Databases, Relational & Non-Relational
- Relational databases use SQL and store data in tables with rows and columns
- Non-Relational data store data using other data structures
